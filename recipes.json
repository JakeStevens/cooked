Line 2 cupcake pans with 18 paper liners and fill the empty cups half full of water to prevent scorching.\nTo make the cupcakes, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder together in a large bowl. In a food processor, blend the canola oil, agave nectar, soy milk, tofu, vanilla extract, and vinegar, scraping down the bowl often. Blend until very smooth, with no chunks of tofu visible, about 2 to 3 minutes. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients. Stir well and spoon into the prepared cupcake pan, leaving some room at the top of each cup. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and place on a cooling rack. Cool completely before filling and frosting.\nTo prepare the filling, blend the tofu in a food processor until very smooth and creamy, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add the agave nectar and blend again. Add the peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt and blend thoroughly until very light and smooth. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours to firm before filling the cupcakes.\nTo assemble the cupcakes, you will need a pastry bag fitted with a large, plain smooth tip. Fill the pastry bag with peanut butter mousse and insert the tip halfway into the top of a cupcake. Squeeze filling inside each cupcake just until it starts to expand.\nNext frost the tops. If the frosting is too firm, heat in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up. Spread the ganache evenly over the tops of the cupcakes. Let the cupcakes sit in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\nGarnish with peanuts if desired.",

    "instructions": "To prepare: Peel the shrimp and save the shells for shrimp oil or shrimp broth or discard them. Pick up a shrimp and make a shallow slit down the middle of the length of the back to expose the black intestine. Slit all the shrimp and lift out the black intestine with the point of your paring knife, or flush it out under cold running water. If using defrosted cleaned shrimp, skip this step. Either way, dry the shrimp well with paper towels and set them aside. Clean the sea scallops by peeling and discarding the little strip of muscle that is attached to one side. (If your scallops are somewhat old the muscle strip may not be there.) Place the scallops in a colander and wash them well under cold running water \u2014 keep an eye open for specks of dark sand. Drain the scallops well and roll them in paper towels to dry them thoroughly. If the scallops are very large, cut them into 1/2\" to 3/4\" pieces (it's the thickness that determines the cooking time, not how wide they are). If you're using bay scallops, don't remove the tiny strip of muscle, it's tender. Either way, set the scallops aside while you're preparing the sauce. Put the bacon fat or vegetable oil into a skillet or stew-type pot that's wide and deep enough to hold all the seafood in about 2 layers with about 2 cups of sauce. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and add the onion, peppers, and celery. Cook the vegetables, adjusting the heat if necessary and stirring frequently, until they have become slightly wilted and a little brown, about 5 minutes. When the vegetables are ready, turn the heat to low and stir in the garlic, thyme, oregano, bay leaf and cayenne, cooking for about 30 seconds. Add the flour and continue to stir for about 1 minute more to cook away its raw taste. Add the tomatoes and their juice, and simmer the sauce, covered, over very low heat, about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are almost tender and it's very thick. Stir the sauce once or twice during this period. Season it generously with salt, pepper, and Tabasco, and set it aside. The sauce can be made 3 or 4 days in advance and refrigerated, but be sure to heat it through before continuing with the recipe. In a separate bowl, mix the scallops and shrimp together and season them well with salt and pepper. (If you're using bay scallops that are smaller than 1/2\" in width, don't mix them with the shrimp at this point \u2014 see Note.) Remove about one half of the sauce to a bowl, spreading the remaining sauce evenly over the bottom of the skillet or pot. Distribute the seafood evenly over the sauce in the skillet and spread the reserved sauce over the top of the seafood \u2014 it won't completely cover. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and, without stirring, heat the mixture until you see 3 or 4 bubbles at the surface. Reduce the heat to very low, tightly cover the skillet, and gently simmer the mixture until the shrimp are white throughout and the scallops are slightly translucent in the center, 8 to 12 minutes, cutting one of each to check, if you're unsure. (If you prefer, you can bake the Creole in a preheated 325\u00b0F oven once the bubbles have come to the surface.) The Creole will be much thinner now from the shellfish juices.

Turn chicken, cover grill, and cook for 10 more minutes. Continue cooking and turning chicken every 10 minutes, covering grill between turns, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165\u00b0F, about 50 minutes total. Transfer to a carving board; let chicken rest for 10-20 minutes. (Resting will make for juicier meat.) While chicken rests, add more coals to fire if necessary to increase heat to medium, or heat gas grill to medium-high. Season chile, bell pepper, and onion with salt and pepper. Grill (or use a grill basket) over medium heat, turning occasionally, until softened and charred in spots, about 12 minutes. Transfer onion to a medium bowl. Transfer chiles and peppers to a work surface and cut lengthwise into 1\" slices. Add to bowl with onion. Add 1/4 cup vinegar to vegetables and toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add basil and stir to wilt. Add basil mixture to bowl with onion. Season vegetables to taste with salt and more vinegar, if desired. Rub cut side of avocados with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt, and sprinkle with chili powder. Grill, cut side down, until avocado is gently warmed and flesh is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Serve chicken with vegetables and avocados.\nOpen chicken and place on a work surface, skin side up. Using your palms, firmly press on breastbone to flatten the breast. Season chicken all over with 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne. Place in a baking dish; rub with 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with lemon zest, and scatter rosemary over. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\nBuild a medium-low fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium. Place chicken, skin side down, on grill and place a brick or heavy skillet on top of chicken to weigh it down. (This will expose more skin to direct heat, making it crispy; the chicken will also cook faster.) Cook until skin is crispy and golden brown, about 15 minutes.\nUsing tongs, set brick aside. Turn chicken, cover grill, and cook for 10 more minutes.

Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and place in the fridge while you make the filling. Beat the cream cheese until smooth and add the sugar. Add the eggs and egg yolks, beating them in one by one until they are incorporated into the cream cheese and sugar. Pour in the sour cream, lime juice, vanilla extract and rum, and beat again until smooth and creamy. Finally fold in the sweetened chestnut pur\u00e9e. Don't worry about making a fully amalgamated mixture: smooth cream cheese with grainy streaks of chestnut is just fine. Line the outside of the springform pan containing the crumb base with a good wrapping of plastic wrap, so that the whole of the bottom and sides are enveloped in plastic.

The best place to look is a farmers' market. The chicken never browns, so if presentation is your thing, avert your eyes\u2014or simply pull the meat from the bones and make a warm salad with escarole, the broth, and prosciutto. Or use the meat and sauce to make a very simple pasta dish. Whatever you do, be careful not to overcook the chicken. And serve it right after cooking, when its aromatics are most intense. The original recipe said it serves 4, but when I made the dish for my mother and me, we polished off the whole thing. Only count on it serving 4 if you're making a bunch of side dishes. It may seem strange to buy expensive prosciutto and cut it into cubes, but don't skimp on the quality of prosciutto. I did once and was punished with a salty sauce. If you can only get indifferent prosciutto, add less of it.\nA great chicken dish deserves (and depends on) a great chicken\u2014buy the highest-quality bird you can find.

When the temperature inside the smoker has reached 200\u00b0F and the wood chips are smoking steadily, add the lamb, and let smoke. Maintain the temperature at 200\u00b0F at least until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reads 160\u00b0F.
